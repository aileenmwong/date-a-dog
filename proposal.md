######Date a Dawg Proposal###

####What is Date a Dawg?###

You are on a date with a dog or "dawg." You can ask the dawg the typical date questions selecting through choices such as, what's your favorite hobby? and what do you like to eat? 

The dawg in turn will also ask you questions that you can answer with given choices. 

Based on the questions and answers that the dog asks, hearts are rewarded and stored at the top of the screen. You are trying to get the most amount of hearts you can. When the date is over, if you have achieved the requisite amount of hearts, the date is either a success or not. 

####Wireframe###

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

####Initial thoughts on game structure###

(Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)

I will need to make an object that I can feed the questions into so I can generate new questions easily. I'm not sure how to achieve this, as each question will have to be different. I imagine if I expand the game beyond the one dog, the objects will be much more reusable. 

The art will also be a little time consuming, but I'm up for the challenge. I know 


Phases of Completion

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)
